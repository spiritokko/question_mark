# Problem A

Given an array of n integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.  

#### Assumption
1. Each input would have exactly one solution
1. May not use the same element twice.

#### Plus
Find a solution with time complexity **O(n)**

##### Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
 ```
